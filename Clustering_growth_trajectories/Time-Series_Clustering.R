# Read the input data from the providede CSV file.

## trajectory for each child.

# In practice, PLA is a dimensionality reduction method. The need is to have all trajectories be
# of equal size to enable the calculation of distances. However, we need to maintain long enough
# trajectories to get meaningful results. For this, we exclude children that have less than
# 8 measurements.

# You will notice that we have a long table. This means that every measurement is a different row.
# This results in multiple rows for every child. Since our goal is to cluster children, we will
# need a row for every child. So, we transform the long table in a wide one, where the IDs are
# the rows, the measurements are the columns and the values are the zBMI scores.

# We can visualize the distances using the factoextra package.
# Blue is "cold" (greater distance), red is "hot" (greater similarity).
# Even in this visualization, you should start discern some groups (boxes of red or blue).
fviz_dist(PLA_EUCL_dist)

# Depending how conservative we want to be with the cohesiveness of our clusters
# (i.e., how red a box easy) we can pick between 2 and 4 clusters. Let's get some more help.
fviz_nbclust(growthPLA, pam, method = "wss") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype=2)
# This visualization should show you how the within sum of square (WSS) value diminishes as we
# increase the number of clusters. Naturally, if we had as many clusters as data points our
# cohesiveness would be perfect, but that's hardly useful. Instead, we pick the value where we
# stop seeing a dramatic improvement in the WSS value (here is at k=4). This is called the
# elbow method (because of the shape of the curve)

# =    4.1.1  Practice   (part 1/2)  =============================================

# Write and submit code to:
## - calculate the DTWARP distances for the Maya growth data.
## - produce the distance visualization.
# Compare the euclidean and the dynamic time warping distances.
## - do you notice significant differences?
## - do you believe that these differences can affect the clustering results?
##   (you can confirm your presumptions later)

# =    4.2  Clustering  =======================================================================

# Now we are ready to apply our clustering, using the pam() method.
mayaPAM<-pam(growthPLA, 4)

mayaPAM #an overview of the results
mayaPAM$clusinfo #check the clustering results
mayaPAM$clustering #check the actual clustering
mayaPAM$medoids #check the medoid data
mayaPAM$silinfo #check the quality by silhouette

# We can also plot the results using either the clusplot() or the fviz_cluster function.
# The results should be similar. Notice that cluster 1 has an isolated point, which can also
# been seen in the elevated silhouette width for this cluster.Notice also that clusters 2 and 3
# seem to have overlapping elements. This is because the data cannot be explained with just
# two dimensions, but this is not important for now.
fviz_cluster(mayaPAM)
clusplot(mayaPAM, main = "Maya Child Growth Data, clusters=4", color=TRUE)

# We can also visualize the silhouette of the clustering to assess its quality.
fviz_silhouette(silhouette(mayaPAM))

# =    4.2.1  Practice  (part 2/2)  ============================================

# Write and submit code to:
## - create a pam clustering using the DTWARP distance;
## - create a hierarchical clustering using the Euclidean distance;
## - create a hierarchical clustering using the DTWARP distance.
# Create the visualizations for all clusterings (cluster plots and dendrograms, colored).
## - Are the clusters similar?
## - Use the cluster.evaluation() function of the TSclust package to quantify the differences.
##   Consider our initial pam-EUCL clustering as the ground truth.
